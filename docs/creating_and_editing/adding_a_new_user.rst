3. After setting a username, there is an option to set a password - the new user can 
   change the password once they have access to the account 
   
.. note:: Steps to change the new users password and personal information is available in another help section

4. Scroll down to add the new user to different workgroups and administration authorities where
   their roles withing the workgroups and administration authorities can be assigned
   
5. Once the information is selected and the new user is in the appropriate workgroups and administration authorities,
   click the option at the bottom of the page (save a continue editing) which will open a new page with a 
   message at the top saying that a new user has successfully been created

   :browser_height: 733
   
6. There is an option to add the new user's personal information, but this is not essential at this point and the 
   new user can add this information later
   
7. Permissions can now be added, by selecting (staff status) the new user will have access to administration information, 
   and by selecting (superuser status) the new user can fully control all the information within the registry
   
8. Once all the permissions are set, creating a new user is done and the user can now edit their own information
