===============================================================

Step 1: From the Dashboard side panel, go to "My Sandbox"

   :server_path: /account/home
   :login: {'url': '/login', "username": "suzie", "password": "Submitter"}

   :crop_element: a[href="/account/sandbox"]
   :clicker: a[href="/account/sandbox"]
   
Step 2: In your Sandbox, you will see a list of your items that you’ve created 
but haven’t registered. Select one item you want to register.
